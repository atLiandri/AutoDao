# AutoDAO
We expect that, in the near future, we will see fully automated companies able to run a business through an Agentic AI-driven decision-making process. Blockchain-based frameworks can help our society guide this evolution in a positive direction by encouraging decentralized ownership of such companies, with full representation of each member.
In this hackathon, we are developing a tool for DAOs that sets the path to realize this vision. Members of the community can explain their needs and ambitions by chatting with an AI agent, which can propose solutions or inquire further details from the user. The agent will then register an appropriate proposal on the DAO contract, which, upon approval, will automatically execute concrete on-chain actions to implement the user's desires. This way, we lower the participation threshold for everyone, facilitating the involvement of each member in the community.
