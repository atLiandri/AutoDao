# AutoDAO
We expect that, in the near future, we will see fully automated companies able to run a business through an Agentic AI-driven decision-making process. Blockchain-based frameworks can help our society guide this evolution in a positive direction by encouraging decentralized ownership of such companies, with full representation of each member.
AutoDao is a tool for DAOs that a tool for DAOs that sets the path to realize this vision, simplifying the active participation of members in the community. Users can explain their needs and ambitions by chatting with an AI agent, which can propose solutions or inquire further details from the user. If the Agent decides the information is sufficient, it will then register an appropriate proposal on the DAO contract, which, upon approval of the majority of the voters, will automatically execute concrete on-chain actions to implement the user's desires.
In our current implementation, we imagined a condomiunium where the agent substitutes the administrator. Based on the current problem stated by the user, the Agent can create proposals that, upon approval, imply sending a payment to a specific address that the agent must choose among an address book of professionals (e.g. plumber, electrician,...)
